## FAQ
- **Why are you doing this?**
The simple answer is, *because I can and I want to*. Our country is going through the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic and it is very important that the people act as a whole and try their best to help those in need. I don't have any way to go out there and help people so I decided to put my skills to use instead and create this bot.

- **How does it work?**
The bot searches for the relevant hashtags in tweets and retweets them. The goal being, exposing the tweets that need attention to the followers of the bot so that the people who might be looking for any information can get it at one place - the bot's tweet history. The hashtags that trigger the bot to retweet currently are: `"#Remdesvir"`, `"#remdesivir"`, `"#oxygen"` and `"#COVIDResourceBot"`. The last one can be used to make the bot retweet a tweet that doesn't contain other hashtags.

- **How does `"#COVIDResourceBot"` work?**
If you have a thread you've made already or you want the bot to retweet a tweet that doesn't have any triggering hashtags, reply to the tweet you want to be retweeted using `"#COVIDResourceBot"` and the bot will retweet it. For threads, you can reply with the hashtag to the first tweet of your thread.

- **How are you sustaining the costs of the servers?**
For the time being, I am paying for the servers and any additional costs. There some samaritans who have donated to the cause which has helped me tremendously. Take a look at the Supporters section [here](#supporters) and you too can donate if you want!

- **Are you making any money off of this?**
No.

- **How do I believe you?**
I have records of all the donations and how the money is being spent which I can reproduce at any given time if asked. **This is not like the PM-CARES fund.**

- **I have a suggestion, how can I contact you?**
You can find me on Twitter to DM at [**@mayurtheboi**](https://twitter.com/mayurtheboi). You can visit my [**GitHub profile**](https://github.com/Mayur57) or [**website**](http://mayurbhoi.com) to find all relevant contact information there.
